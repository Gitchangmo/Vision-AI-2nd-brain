## [2026-07-21] ingest | 2nd-Brain 개인지식 관리 원본 배치

- Selection: `understand-chat` identified the 2nd-Brain PKM core subgraph and its one-hop canonical neighbors; their leading frontmatter referenced 13 unique raw sources.
- Created:
  - `raw/notebooklm/2026-07-16-all-notes.md`
  - `raw/notebooklm/codegraph-github.md`

  - `raw/youtube/📺 LLM Wiki를 업그레이드하는 외부 지식 시스템! 연구자를 위한 최강의 조합 Zotero × Notebook × Obsidian x Claude Code.md`
  - `raw/youtube/📺 Orca Is the Free Cursor Killer Nobody's Talking About!.md`
- Updated: `SCHEMA.md`, `AGENTS.md` to register importer-preserved raw directories and legacy hash-coverage handling.
- Integrity: all 13 target files are byte-identical to the source vault; all 8 recorded post-frontmatter body hashes match; 5 legacy web/video captures have no recorded `sha256` and retain their original missing final LF as explicit coverage and format gaps.
- Canonical state: unchanged at 0 pages; `index.md` was not modified.

## [2026-07-21] lint | 0 issues found

- Raw files in the imported source set: 13.
- Source/target byte-identical files: 13.
- Recorded post-frontmatter body hashes checked and matched: 8.
- Documented legacy hash-coverage and final-LF format gaps: 5.
- Invalid UTF-8, BOM, CRLF, body-hash drift, missing ingest-log paths, and unregistered importer directories: 0.
- Canonical pages and index entries: 0; no canonical navigation update was required.

## [2026-07-21] create | 2nd-Brain canonical 지식 코어

- Evidence: the existing 13-file raw source set was mapped to eight central, reusable PKM subjects; no raw record was duplicated or mutated.
- Created:
  - `concepts/ai-knowledge-workflow.md`
  - `concepts/ai-personal-knowledge-management.md`
  - `concepts/llm-wiki.md`
  - `concepts/research-feedback-loop.md`
  - `concepts/second-brain-research-workflow.md`
  - `comparisons/knowledge-tool-roles.md`
  - `queries/notebooklm-query-compounding.md`
  - `queries/ua-knowledge-graph-workflow.md`
- Updated:
  - `SCHEMA.md`
  - `index.md`
  - `log.md`
- Navigation: the eight-page graph uses only resolvable canonical wikilinks, with at least two distinct non-self links per page.
- Provenance: every source and claim marker resolves to an existing repository-relative raw Markdown path.

## [2026-07-21] lint | 0 issues found

- Canonical pages: 8 total (5 concepts, 1 comparison, and 2 queries); all required frontmatter fields, types, dates, confidence values, contestation fields, and contradiction lists are valid.
- Taxonomy and navigation: 9 registered tags, 8 exact alphabetical index entries, 33 canonical links, minimum 3 outbound links per page, and minimum 2 inbound links per page.
- Provenance: 27 source references and 17 claim-level markers resolve to existing raw Markdown records; no marker is absent from its page source list.
- Raw integrity: 13 Markdown records checked, 8 recorded body hashes matched, and 5 importer-preserved legacy hash/final-LF coverage gaps remain documented.
- Formatting, duplicate slugs, broken links, self-links, orphan pages, source drift, and lint warnings: 0.

## [2026-07-21] repair | lint source-reference count correction

- Correction: the immediately preceding lint entry reports 27 source references, but the measured canonical frontmatter total is 30.
- Unchanged measurements: 17 claim-level markers, 33 canonical links, 8 canonical pages, and 0 lint errors or warnings.
- Updated: `log.md` only; no raw or canonical page was changed.
